        <section class="main-section" id="Introduction" ><header><h1>Introduction</h1></header><p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p> <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p> <code>var x=prompt("enter your name:")</code> <ul></ul></section>
        <section class="main-section" id="What_you_should_already_know" ><header><h1>What you should already know</h1></header><p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p> <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p> <code>var x=greetme("world");</code></section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world" ><header><h1>Hello world</h1></header><p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p> <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");</code><p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p> </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope" ><header><h1>Variable scope</h1></header><p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p> <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p> <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined</code></section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types" ><header><h1>Data types</h1></header><p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p> <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p> <code>x="name"(string) x=10(integer)</code>
